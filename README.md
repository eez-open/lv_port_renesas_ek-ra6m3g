# LVGL ported to Renesas EK-RA6M3G

## Overview

The EK-RA6M3G evaluation kit enables users to seamlessly evaluate the features of the RA6M3 MCU Group and develop embedded systems applications using Renesas’ Flexible Software Package (FSP) and e2 studio IDE. Utilize rich on-board features along with your choice of popular ecosystem add-ons to bring your big ideas to life.

The MCU has a high-performance Arm Cortex-M4 core and offers a TFT controller with 2D accelerator and JPEG decoder. Additionally, it has Ethernet MAC with individual DMA and USB high-speed interface to ensure high data throughput

## Buy

You can purchase the Renesas EK-RA6M3G board from many distributors. See the sources at https://renesas.com/ek-ra6m3g

## Benchmark

???
During the benchmark 2 frame buffer were used in the external SRRAM. LVGL was configured to `LV_DISPLAY_RENDER_MODE_DIRECT` and the buffer were swapped on VSYNC to avoid tearing.
